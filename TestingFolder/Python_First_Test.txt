Basic Python Test1.

1. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of three given numbers, 
   if the values are equal then return three times of their sum

example : a = 3, b = 5, c = 7 : output = 15
example : a = 2, b = 2, c = 2 : output = total_sum*3 : 6*3 : 18

2. Write a Python program that will return true if the two given integer 
   values are equal or their sum or difference is 5

example : a =4, b=4 : output : True
example : a =5, b=10 : b-a == 5 : Output: True
example : a =2, b=3  : a+b = 5 : Output : True

3. Write a python program to print given pattern:
1
2 3 
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
9 8 7 
6 5
4

4. Write a python program to calculat interest amount.
Formula:
A = P (1 + rt)
A	=	final amount
P	=	initial principal balance
r	=	annual interest rate
t	=	time (in years)


5. Write a python program to calulate total bill with discount.

-> get order amount as input
-> if order amount is between 1000 - 2000 : dicount 5%
-> if order amount is between 2000- 3000 : dicount 10%
-> if order amount is between 3000- 4000 : dicount 15%
-> if order amount is between 4000- 5000 : dicount 20%
-> if order amount is greater than 5000 : dicount 25%

6. Write a python program Format given string.

str1 = "Python Programming Is best"
Ouput = "ppYTHOnn ppROGRAMMINgg iiss bbEStt"

7. Write a python  program to remove duplicate char from given string.

str1 = "Programming"
output = "Progamin"

8. Write python program to print given string format.

str1 = "learning programming"
output = "LeArNiNg PrOgRaMmIng"

temp = ''
for i in range(len(str))

  if i%2 == 0:
     temp = temp + str1[i].upper()
  else:
     temp = temp + str1[i].lower()
