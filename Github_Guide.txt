1. Create Github account
2. Create reposirtory on the github server
3. Download git installer and install on windows machine.
   https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.38.1.windows.1/Git-2.38.1-64-bit.exe

4. Create a folder on the machine on specific location
   e.g gitrepo

5. Open git base on the same location where we can created the folder.
    right click -> git base here :  new git hub command prompt will open.

6. git clone https://github.com/sqatools/PythonLearningBi11.git

7. Repository folder will be created locally now navigate in that folder
   cd <folder>

8. Creat a new file in that repo directory

9. Check the status of newly file : 
    -> git status : it will the file in untrac section with red color.

   [main (root-commit) ae3b7c3] We are sending first file to repo
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
   create mode 100644 first_python_porgram.py

13. Next we will push the local commit on the server

   $ git push : it you are first time push, then it will ask for credentials
    $ git push
